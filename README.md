# API REST with MySQL
- This project was created with the objective of putting into practice my knowledge in backend technologies, such as Node Js, Express Js. I have experience creating REST APIs with direct connections to the database, with MySQL as in this case, but with this project I made the decision to create a REST API without using an ORM, I use Sequelize to create these types of projects, however, it is a good idea to try to create an application with other methods.
